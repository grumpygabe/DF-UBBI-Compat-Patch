# DF-UBBI-Compat-Patch
A compatibility patch for Darkness Falls.

# Requirements
[Darkness Falls](https://dev.azure.com/KhaineUK/_git/DarknessFallsA20) and the A19 version of [Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1242)

# Description
This is a simple compatibility patch to make the A19 version of Ztensity's wonderful UBBI mod work with A20/V4 Darkness Falls.  It will not work with vanilla.

As part of this fix, this mod makes the storage for all the UBBI containers the larger DFPlayerStorage size.  Some might call this EZ CLAP, but it made the xml more simple and makes everything more usable.

I'm not entirely sure all the UBBI specific drops are working - I know cooking springs drop but not the electronic parts.  These are largely redundant with Darkness Fall's additions, however, so it should not pose a large problem to the player.

# Installation
Drop the "9-UBBI-DFStoragePatch" in your mods folder.  You will also need Ztensity's UBBI mod (link above), and for the purposes of mods loading in the correct order, I would change the name of that mod's folder to something alone the lines of "8-ZT-UBBI".  This ensures it loads before the compatibility patch.
